# Medicine-Schedule
Program that optimizes schedule for taking medicine.

This program takes in a medicine/vitamin name, associated with an intake frequency per day & intake frequency per week, then outputs a weekly schedule for the user, creating an efficient schedule to organize the user's medicine/vitamin intake. This will ensure that the user does not unnecessarily overlap medicine/vitamin intake.
